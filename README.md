# Kali-Clean

My kali i3 desktop setup. I forked from the excellent xct repo.

After cloning the repo just run ./install.sh from a non-root user.

To be updated soon (replacing oh-my-zsh with oh-my-posh, changing wallpaper etc)

## Installation

```
./install.sh
```

After the script is done reboot and select i3 (top right corner) on the login screen. Then open a terminal (`ctrl+return`) run `lxappearance`and select ark-dark theme and change the icons to whatever you like (I used papyrus).
